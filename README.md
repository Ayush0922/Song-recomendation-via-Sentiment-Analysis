# Song-recomendation-via-Sentiment-Analysis

Emotion-Based Music Recommendation with OpenCV and Spotify

This project uses OpenCV for face detection and emotion recognition, and Spotify's API to recommend music based on your current emotion.
Features

    Analyzes your emotions through your webcam.
    Recommends songs based on a basic emotion-to-genre mapping.
    Displays the detected emotion and recommended song on the webcam feed.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2)
    DeepFace
    Spotipy

Installation:

Read How-to.txt to get the full installation support. xoxo.

Spotify API Credentials:

You will need to obtain a Spotify Developer account and create an app to get your client ID and client secret. Replace 'your_client_id' and 'your_client_secrets' in the code with your own credentials.
To get the Spotify Client ID and Client Secret, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and register an application. Here’s how you can do it:
Steps to Get Spotify Client ID and Secret:

    Create a Spotify Developer Account:
        Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
        If you don't already have a Spotify account, you'll need to create one. Otherwise, log in with your existing Spotify credentials.

    Create a New App:
        Once logged in, click on "Create an App".
        Fill in the required details such as the App Name and App Description.
        Accept the terms and conditions by checking the box and then click "Create".

    View Your App’s Dashboard:
        After creating the app, you’ll be redirected to the app’s dashboard.
        Here, you will see your Client ID displayed at the top of the page.
        To get your Client Secret, click on "Show Client Secret" under the Client ID. You might need to confirm your password for security reasons.

    Use the Client ID and Client Secret:
        Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.
        You can now use them in your Python application to authenticate with the Spotify API.

Security Note:

    Keep your Client Secret confidential. Do not share it publicly or include it in code repositories that others can access. For added security, consider using environment variables or a secrets manager to store these credentials.


Running the Project

    Save the code as main.py.
    Open a terminal in the project directory.
    Run the script:
    python3 main.py

Use code with caution.

    The script will open your webcam and analyze your emotions in real-time, recommending songs based on the detected emotion. Press 'q' to quit.

How it Works

    The script initializes OpenCV to capture video from your webcam.
    It uses DeepFace to analyze the emotions in each frame.
    A basic mapping between emotions and genres is defined (e.g., happy -> happy music).
    Spotipy is used to search for a song in the chosen genre.
    The detected emotion and recommended song are displayed on the webcam feed.
    The script skips frames to reduce processing load.

Note: This is a basic implementation and can be further improved by:

    Expanding the emotion-to-genre mapping for more nuanced recommendations.
    Adding logic to handle situations where no song is found.
    Integrating with a music player to automatically play the recommended song.
