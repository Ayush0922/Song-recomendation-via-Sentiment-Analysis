# Song-recomendation-via-Sentiment-Analysis

Introduction

This Python-based project aims to create a song recommendation system that leverages sentiment analysis to suggest songs based on a user's current mood. By analyzing the user's sentiment, the system can provide personalized song recommendations that align with their emotional state.

How it Works

    Sentiment Analysis: The system processes text input from the user, such as a sentence or phrase describing their mood.
    Mood Classification: Using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, the input text is classified into a specific mood category (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
    Song Recommendation: Based on the identified mood category, the system retrieves a list of songs that are associated with that particular emotion from a curated song database.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Required libraries:
        pandas
        numpy
        nltk
        textblob
        sklearn
        requests
        spotipy (for Spotify integration)

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/song-recommendation-system

    Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Use code with caution.

    Configure Spotify API:
        Create a Spotify Developer account and obtain your client ID and client secret.
        Replace the placeholder values in the config.py file with your credentials.

Usage

    Run the application:
    Bash

    python t1.py

    Use code with caution.

    Enter your mood:
        The system will prompt you to input a sentence or phrase describing your mood.
    Receive recommendations:
        Based on your input, the system will provide a list of recommended songs.

Future Enhancements

    Expand the song database to include a wider variety of genres and artists.
    Implement user preferences to tailor recommendations to individual tastes.
    Explore other sentiment analysis models for improved accuracy.
    Integrate with music streaming platforms for seamless playback.

Note: This is a basic outline. You may need to adjust the structure and content of the README based on the specific implementation details of your project.
